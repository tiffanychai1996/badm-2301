## Operations

### Teaching Methods

#### More Practice than Theory

This course calls for a required lab component to ensure students acquire relevant technical skills.

Emphasis will be placed on providing students with experiential and active learning opportunities.

Accordingly, instruction will more often take the form of lab sessions and support sessions than lecture sessions.

#### Accompanying Textbook

The following text book has been assigned to accompany this course:

title | author | edition | isbn | price range
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Intro to Information Systems | Rainer | 5th | 9781118674369 | $62.50 - $176.75

Relevant material from the textbook will be covered during lectures.

Students may optionally choose to purchase, borrow, or loan the book
 for additional context.

### Evaluation Methods

There are no exams for this course.
 Student learning will be evaluated through the submission of assignments.

#### Assignments

All [Assignments](ASSIGNMENTS.md) must be delivered
 before the end of the last day of the semester (midnight concluding 12/9).

Each assignment carries a suggested delivery date to help students manage their time.
 In some cases, assignment delivery dates are not flexible (e.g. in-class lab assignments).

Assignments submitted by the delivery date
 will be evaluated/graded by an instructor
 within a reasonable amount of time (roughly one or two weeks following the delivery date).

Often, evaluation will contain
 feedback on how to improve the submission.

### Communication and Collaboration

To ensure students receive sufficient instructional support
 and equal access to the time and attention of instructors,
 and to provide students with hands-on experience using [contemporary business collaboration tools](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/the-secret-startup-saved-healthcare-gov-the-worst-website-in-america/397784/),
 members of the Learning Community will communicate and collaborate according to a specified set of [tools and guidelines](COMMUNICATIONS.md).
